Simulates an ecosystem with hares, deer and wolves. Simulations are done both deterministically and with random walkers on a grid. Simulations without aging are compared with those without aging. Simulations are run in a system with wolves and hares, with wolves and deer and with all three species. The results from the stochastic simulations are stored in three separate directories. Animations generated from the code are not found on Github as they are more than 100 MB each.

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- Numpy
